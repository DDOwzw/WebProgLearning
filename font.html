<p>I got that link off of your website, please note the rate for the Reliant basic plan: 5.2. The only other one that is even close is the Bounce “Thrifty <span>fwfwfwfwfw</span>Saver” that comes with “Earn choice of FREE movie tickets or companion airfare, bill credits, and FREE electricity!”

I don’t want movie tickets, I want a cheap rate, and this Reliant product is fantastic. You make it sound like a ripoff and like they are trying to pull something over on their customers. On the electricity ratings website at least, the customer service fees are clearly documented.

In short, it is not a ripoff or a scam, it is a moderately priced product that meets the needs of some but not all customers, kind of like a product you would expect a company to offer that is trying to serve its customers well.

I think the tone of your post is needlessly provocative as well as that of EnergyMan. “As a common courtesy” as if customer support personnel grow free on trees. Your tone is needlessly provocative and misplaced and your criticism seems completely unjustified and unfair.</p>
